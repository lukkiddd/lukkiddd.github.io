- [[Recommender System - Accuracy or Relevance]]
	- The recommendation suggested to a user should be relevant because that a user has a **high propensity to purchase the recommended items** and rate them highly.
	- Prediction accuracy is not enough
- Recommender System - Novelty
	- the recommender system should provide users with **options that are not already known to the users**.
- Recommender System - Diversity
	- A list of recommendations suggested to a user should be diverse to increase the chance of a conversion.
- [[Recommender System - Serendipity]]
	- Recommendations can help a user discover products that are **unexpected and surprising**, as well as a novel
- [[Recommender System - Coverage]]
	- The percentage of users or items over which the system can make recommendations
