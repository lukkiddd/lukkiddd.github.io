### Notes
- Context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time
- the CTR overestimates the actual impact for popular items, and thus gives a skewed impression of the actual performance. Only comparing the actual article views can give a true picture of actual performance. 
- Placing the recommendations at the top of the page more than doubled the CTR than at the bottom 

### Result
Increase in CTR about 35% for longer user sessions (context tree vs random)
