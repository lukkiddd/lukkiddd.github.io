### Summary
**Author**: [[Amy Edmonson]]
**My review**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)


#### Ideas
- Driving goal with fear can hurt
- Silent can be dangerous
- Listen with empathy can help


#### Solutions
- Setting the Stage
	- Frame the work
	- Emphasize Purpose
- Inviting Participation
	- Demonstrate Situational Humility
	- Practice Inquiry
	- Set up Structures and Process
- Responding Productively
	- Express Appreciation
	- Destigmatize (ทำลายล้าง) Failure
	- Sanction Clear Violations


#### Notes
- Then the book told us about the meaning of [[Psychological Safety]], as well as examples, a lot of them, of how bad psychological safety will impact the organization's output, or the persons' life. And how good it is, if we do it well.
	-  Some interesting notes
		- [[VUCA - volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity]]
		- [[The five keys to a successful Google team]]
	- Interesting examples
		- [[Brain Trust at Pixar]]
		- [[Work Principle from Ray Dalio]]
		- [Sully film - 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjKEXxO2KNE&ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures)
- The end of the book are about the solutions, how to create [[Psychological Safety]], and the different question when trying to developing in the organization.
	- From my point of view, the solution is the same as reWork tools which I've mentioned in [[Psychological Safety]]
