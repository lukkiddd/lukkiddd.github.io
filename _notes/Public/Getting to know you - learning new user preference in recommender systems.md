### Notes

- Experimental design
	- **Goal**: Measure the effectiveness of the signup process
	- **Metrics**:
		- User effort - How hard was it to sign up
		- Accuracy - How well can the system make recommendations to the users
	- **Reults**
		- Random/Classique perform worst
		- Popularity, (log) Popularity * Entropy, Item-Item personalized strategies give the reasonable performance on both metrics
