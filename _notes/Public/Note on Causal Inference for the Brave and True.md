- When Association IS Causation
	- Y0i is the potential outcome for unit i without treatment
	- Y1i is the potential outcome for **the same** unit i with the treatment
	- Y1i - Y0i is the potential outcomes of individual treatment effect
	- Average Treatment Effect (ATE) = E[Y1 - Y0]
	- Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) = E[Y1 - Y0 | T = 1]



E[600 + 750] - E[500 + 600] = E[600 + 750] - E[500 + 600]
