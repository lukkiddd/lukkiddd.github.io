### Notes
- Accuracy is not enough
- Introduce intra-list similarity metric to measure diversity which improves user satisfaction
- Propose topic diversification method to increase diversity


> The Intra-List Similarity Metric and the process of Topic Diversification for recommendation lists. Returned lists can be altered to either increase or decrease the diversity of items on that list.


### Results

Results showed that these altered lists performed worse on accuracy measures than unchanged lists, but users preferred the altered lists.
