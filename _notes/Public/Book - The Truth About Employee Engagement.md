### Summary
**Author**: [[Patrick Lencioni]]
**My review**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Summarise**
- Anonumity (การไม่มีตัวตน)
	- Knowing other people as a person
	- We do not need to be different person at work
- Irrelevance (การไม่ส่งผลกระทบ)
	- We often make a direct impact to your direct report or internal teams
	- Setting the goals/objective that helps you see the impact to other people's life.
	- What changes you have made that impact other's life.
- Immeasurement (การไม่ได้ประเมินผล)
	- Monitoring your result will help you understand how you impact others.
	- It can be a simple metrics based on behaviors for example, number of smile you receive from your stakeholders
