> MLOps stands for Machine Laerning Operations. MLOps is a core function of Machine Learning engineering, focused on streamlining the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. MLOps is a collaborative function, often comprising data scientist, devops engineers, and IT.

> MLOps is an ML engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system development (Dev) and ML system operations (Ops). Practicing MLOps means that you advocate for automation and monitoring at all steps of ML system construction, including integration, testing, releasing, deployment and infrastructure management.

> MLOps is a set of practices for collaboration and communication between data scientist and operations professionals. Applying these practices increases the quality, simplifies the management process, and automates the deployment of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in large-scale production environments. It's easier to align models with business needs, as well as regulartory requirements.
