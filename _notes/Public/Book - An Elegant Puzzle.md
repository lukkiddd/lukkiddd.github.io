## Notes

### 3.14 Time Management

#### 1. Quarterly Time Retrospective

This idea is interesting to try, it should help reflect how I spend my time. I'll share again the result after applying it.

#### 2. Long-term over Short-term

I have heard this for a while, in reality, I often forget to think about it. Next time, I need to remind myself to aware for my future decisions

#### 3. Finish Small Leveraged Things

Leverage all the works we've done, those works should bring us more free time.

#### 4. Stop doing things

#### 5. Size Backward, not Forward

The example of the book is useful, sizing based on time we have, instead of based on what we want to do.

#### 6. Calendar Blocker

It works!, that's it!.
