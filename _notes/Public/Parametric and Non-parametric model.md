#### Parametric
- Associate with normal distributions (mean, median, and mode)

#### Non-Parametric
- Cannot assume the data comes from a normal distribution

For example, a study comparing ranked personal preferences will want to use non-parametric statistics to represent the data as the values arenâ€™t going to be normally distributed.
