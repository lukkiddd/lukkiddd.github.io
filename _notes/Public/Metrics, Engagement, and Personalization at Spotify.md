#### Notes

- Optimization metrics quantify how users engage within a session and act as proxy of satisfaction
	- save
	- long click
	- post
	- follow
	- click to stream
	- impression to click
	- dwell time
	- percentage completion
- Why several metrics
	- Different part/ type of content needs different metrics
	- Different user phases need different metrics
	- Different structure of the site and content need different engagement metrics
- Understanding intents
- Optimizing for the right metric
- Acting on segmentation
	- Genre diversity
	- Landing page quality
- Thinking about diversity
	- Satisfaction
	- Popularity
- Intra-session engagement
	- During the session
	- Easily mislead, especially for a short time
- Inter-session management
	- Across sessions
- We optimize (and monitor) intra-session metrics but those that move the inter-session metrics
