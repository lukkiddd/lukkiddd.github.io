### Notes

#### 1. Coverage
- The coverage of a recommender is a measure of the domain of items over which the system can make recommendations
- 2 concepts
	1. The percentage of the items for which the system is able to generate the recommendation (refered as "prediction coverage")
	2. The percentage of the available items which effectively are ever recommended to a user [4,11] (refered as "catalogue coverage")



#### 2. Serendipity
- Serendipity is defined as a measure of the extent to which the recommended items are both attractive and surprising to the users
- 2 aspects
	1. A serendipitous item should be not yet discovered and not be expected by the user
	2. The item should also be interesting, relevant and useful to the user


##### 2.1 Metrics

##### 2.1.1 Unexpected

We asume that a primitive prediction model shows high ratability and produces low unexpectedness.

```
Unexpected = RS/PM

RS = The recommendations generated by a recommender system
PM = A set of recommendations generated by a primitive prediction model
```

##### 2.1.2 Useful

```
Serendipity = sum(u(RS_i)) where i is 1 through N / N

u(RS_i) is a usefulness for the recommendation  if the recommendation in an unexpected list, and usefulness function can be judge by the user.
```


#### 3. Tradeoff

- Catalog coverage usually decreases as a function of accuracy
- Not every increase in coverage leads to serendipity
- Increase in seredipity will lead to higher catalog coverage
- Increase in accuracy leads to less of serendipity
- Increasing serendipity might negatively impact accuracy
