Retention rate is the percentage of customers a business retains over a given period of time. This is a critical success metric for subscription-based businesses. A high retention rate logically would show that a business has a low churn rate.



Retention Rate = Number of active active users that continue their subscription / Total number of active users at the beginning of time period
