### Notes
- Realize that you have nothing to fear from knowing the truth
- Have integrity and demand it from others
- Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up
- Be radically transparent
- Meaningful relationship and meaningful work are mutually reinforcing especially when supported by radical truth and radical transparency
